BASIC PHONOLOGY STUFF
=====================
* what ways of representing IPA sounds will be used
  -- how many diacritics will we support
  -- tautological forms
* how to represent diphthongs
  -- bearing in mind that they pattern differently from consonant clusters and take roles
     more like pure vowels in systems-analyses

CLEVER PHONOLOGY STUFF
======================
* production of charts
* syllable structure and phonotactics
  -- deriving FROM lexicon
  -- defining manually/correcting autoderived rules
  -- detecting errors in lexicon
* customizable word generator -- basically, a bit of probability shit on top of our word-handling

SOUND CHANGES
=============
* what should PyLautLang look like?
* some notion of sound change objects
* arranging sound change objects in time and space
* extensible parser for $sound_change_language 
* sound-change/phonology interactions
  -- updating of clever phonology stuff
  -- warnings about gaps in systems/systemzwang stuff produced by sound changes
* tracking of lexicons
  -- noting when irregular forms/declensions/conjugations/analogy opportunities are created
  
MISC
====
* unlimited rice pudding
