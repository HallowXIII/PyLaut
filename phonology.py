what should a phonology store?

PHONEMES, obviously -- a set of Phones as The Phonemic Vowels, from which allophonic
+ suprasegmental variants are derived

but also systems
 -- allophony
 -- suprasegmentals
 -- system analysis -- systemzwang

Vowels
------

dhok has compiled a big list + classified vowel systems at http://www.incatena.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=41583
classifying a collection of vowels like this would be a start

something which goes 'lol ur vowels are the same as in <list of languages here>'
this should be pretty easy, i think, since it is just looking at sets of vowels

short + long vowel systems
and vowel subsystems generally c.f. nort: http://www.incatena.org/viewtopic.php?p=1047560#p1047560

actually, get nort to consult, he is a vowelf*cker
